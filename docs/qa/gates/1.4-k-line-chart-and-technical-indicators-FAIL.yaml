# QA Gate Decision

## Story: 1.4 - K 线图表和技术指标可视化

### Gate Status: ❌ FAIL

### Decision Rationale

**Critical Issue**: Complete lack of test coverage for all 5 acceptance criteria. This represents a significant quality risk for core business functionality.

### Requirements Traceability

### Quality Assessment

#### Test Coverage: 0% (Critical)
- **Unit Tests**: 0% - No component or utility tests
- **Integration Tests**: 0% - No API integration tests
- **E2E Tests**: 0% - No user journey tests
- **Performance Tests**: 0% - No performance validation

#### Risk Analysis
- **Business Risk**: High - Core stock chart functionality untested
- **Technical Risk**: High - Financial calculations unvalidated
- **User Experience Risk**: High - Mobile and interaction features untested
- **Performance Risk**: High - No performance guarantees

### Blocking Issues

1. **No Chart Library Tests**
   - Impact: Cannot verify K-line rendering accuracy
   - Risk: Financial data display errors

2. **No Technical Indicator Tests**
   - Impact: MA, MACD, RSI calculations unvalidated
   - Risk: Incorrect trading signals

3. **No Performance Tests**
   - Impact: Cannot guarantee <100ms rendering requirement
   - Risk: Poor user experience

4. **No Mobile Tests**
   - Impact: Mobile functionality unverified
   - Risk: Broken mobile experience

### Required Actions

#### Immediate (P0 - Must complete before release)
1. Create K-line chart component tests
2. Implement technical indicator calculation tests
3. Add performance benchmark tests
4. Create mobile interaction tests

#### Short Term (P1 - Within 2 weeks)
1. Implement chart interaction tests
2. Add theme system integration tests
3. Create E2E user journey tests
4. Establish CI/CD quality gates

#### Success Criteria
- Test coverage > 85%
- All critical paths tested
- Performance benchmarks met
- Mobile functionality verified

### Recommendation

**FAIL** - Cannot proceed with release until minimum test coverage is achieved. This represents unacceptable quality risk for core financial functionality.

### Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Create P0 test suite (estimated 3-5 days)
2. **Priority 2**: Implement CI/CD integration (estimated 1-2 days)
3. **Priority 3**: Execute full test suite and validate coverage (estimated 1 day)

### Re-evaluation

Schedule re-evaluation after P0 test suite implementation and minimum 80% coverage achieved.
