# NFR Assessment: 1.4

Date: 2025-09-02
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Implementation pending, validation requirements defined
- Performance: CONCERNS - Targets documented but no implementation to validate
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling strategies documented but not implemented
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage requirements defined but 0% current coverage

## Critical Issues

1. **No implementation exists** (All NFRs)
   - Risk: All requirements are theoretical until implementation
   - Fix: Proceed with development following documented specifications

2. **Test coverage at 0%** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: No validation of functionality or performance
   - Fix: Implement comprehensive test suite during development

## Quick Wins

- Follow documented performance optimization strategies during implementation
- Implement test-driven development to meet coverage requirements
- Use existing chart component patterns from performance optimization docs

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Performance**: Use lightweight-charts library with lazy loading
2. **Security**: Implement input validation for all chart data parameters
3. **Reliability**: Add error boundaries and graceful degradation
4. **Maintainability**: Target >85% test coverage from the start
